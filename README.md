🚀 🚀Building a Versatile Calculator Using JavaFX🚀🚀



We recently developed a versatile calculator that combines both basic and advanced functionalities, providing a comprehensive tool for a variety of mathematical operations. This calculator includes features such as simple arithmetic calculations, scientific functions, a history log, and theme options (black and white). Built using JavaFX for the user interface and Java Evaluator for evaluating expressions, the calculator also employs data structures like linked lists and arrays for efficient functionality. This blog post details the features, tools, and techniques used in creating this multifaceted calculator.



🚀Project Overview🚀



The project encompasses several key features:

⏩ Simple Calculator: Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). 

⏩Scientific Calculator: Advanced mathematical functions (trigonometry, logarithms, exponentiation, etc.). 

⏩History Feature: Keeps track of previous calculations. 

⏩Theme Options: Allows switching between black and white themes for better user experience. 

⏩Tools and Libraries Used JavaFX: A powerful library for building graphical user interfaces in Java. Java Evaluator: A library to evaluate mathematical expressions. Data Structures: Linked list for managing history and arrays for accessing buttons.





🚀Setting Up the UI with JavaFX🚀



JavaFX provides a rich set of tools for building modern user interfaces. The UI for the calculator consists of a display area, buttons for digits and operations, and additional components for scientific functions and theme switching.



🚀Implementing Functionality with Java Evaluator🚀



The Java Evaluator library simplifies the process of evaluating mathematical expressions entered by the user. Integrating this library into the calculator allows it to handle both simple and scientific calculations.



🚀Managing History with Linked List🚀



A linked list is used to manage the history of calculations. This data structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of history entries, making it ideal for this feature.

🚀Accessing Buttons with Arrays🚀



Arrays are used to store and manage the buttons on the calculator. This approach provides quick access to buttons and simplifies the process of adding functionality to each button.



🚀Theme Switching🚀



Implementing theme switching involves changing the style properties of the UI components based on user selection. This feature enhances the user experience by providing a customizable interface.
